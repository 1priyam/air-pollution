        <p class="left-aligned">Learn about the causes, effects, and solutions to air pollution.Air pollution is one of the greatest threats to childrenâ€™s health. Ninety-nine per cent of people in the world live in places where the air is considered unhealthy. When children breathe toxic air, it harms their health and jeopardizes their future.

          For children to grow up healthy, they need clean, safe air. Here are some ways you can reduce air pollution in your environment and help protect your child from its impacts.</p>

    <div class="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.

        Air quality is closely related to the earth's climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i.e., burning of fossil fuel.
        
        Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and lung cancer. Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores, impaired cognition, increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health.The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
        <p class="cair">Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide.Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols.</p>

        <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
        <p class="cair">Air pollution can harm us when it accumulates in the air in high enough concentrations.
            Millions of Americans live in areas where urban smog, particle pollution, and toxic
            pollutants pose serious health concerns. People exposed to high enough levels of
            certain air pollutants may experience:
            <ul><li>Irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat</li>
            <li>Wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and breathing difficulties</li>
            <li>Worsening of existing lung and heart problems, such as asthma</li>
            </li>Increased risk of heart attack</li>
        </li>In addition, long-term exposure to air pollution can cause cancer and damage to the
            immune, neurological, reproductive, and respiratory systems. In extreme cases, it can</li>

        <h2>How can we control Air Pollution</h2>
        <p class="cair">Effective control and reduction of air pollution necessitate a comprehensive approach that addresses various sources and factors contributing to poor air quality. Implementing and enforcing stringent environmental regulations is crucial, with a focus on limiting emissions from industries and vehicles. Transitioning to clean energy sources, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, plays a pivotal role in reducing the release of harmful pollutants. Improving fuel quality, promoting public transportation, and encouraging alternative modes of commuting are vital strategies. Additionally, initiatives like tree plantation, proper waste management, and the creation of green spaces contribute to mitigating air pollution. Public awareness campaigns, technological innovations, and international cooperation further enhance the collective effort required to achieve significant improvements in air quality. Combining regulatory measures with sustainable practices and community engagement forms a holistic approach to combatting air pollution and fostering a healthier environment.</p>
